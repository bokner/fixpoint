1. ~~Stateful propagators (needed for 'sum')~~ done
2. ~~Handle propagators that do not have a chance to be fired (like 'less_or_equal' in case bounds of vars do not intersect)~~ done
3. ~~Level of parallelism for space processes as a solver option~~ done
4. ~~Support solver final status (:satisfied, :all_solutions, :optimal, :unsatisfiable)~~ done, final and runtime statuses supported
5. More search strategies
6. Add stats for propagators
7. (Maybe) add timestamps and/or elapsed time for solutions
8. (Maybe) add objective values to solutions or give an API to derive them from solution + shared objective
9. 'equal'
10. AllDifferent with graphs
11. 'element', 'circuit'
12. Reification
