1. ~~Stateful propagators (needed for 'sum')~~ done
2. ~~Handle propagators that do not have a chance to be fired (like 'less_or_equal' in case bounds of vars do not intersect)~~ done
3. ~~Level of parallelism for space processes as a solver option~~ done
4. ~~Support solver final status (:satisfied, :all_solutions, :optimal, :unsatisfiable)~~ done, final and runtime statuses supported
5. ~~More search strategies~~ done
6. ~~Distributed solving~~ done
7. Document Solver API
8. Add stats for propagators
9. (Maybe) add timestamps and/or elapsed time for solutions
10. (Maybe) add objective values to solutions or give an API to derive them from solution + shared objective
11. 'equal'
12. AllDifferent with forward checking
13. AllDifferent with graphs
14. 'element', 'circuit'
15. Reification
16. AFC (accumulated failure count) strategy
