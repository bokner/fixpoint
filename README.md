# Constraint Programming Solver

## The approach 
The implementation follows the ideas described in Chapter 12, "Concepts, Techniques, and Models
  of Computer Programming" by Peter Van Roy and Seif Haridi.

## Status
WIP. A single 'not_equal' constraint is implemented. Small instances of Graph Coloring and N-Queens work,
but are slow and unstable. Significant API changes and core implementation rewrites are expected.
